# Machine-Learning-Gradient-Descent
Project i made for the Stanford online course of machine learning

I renamed some files and edited the text so i can safelly post here on github. 
I have no intation to share the answers and this is purelly for my learning and for my CV.

I will eventually make this gradient descent/linear regression in one or two files, so it can be more usefull.
But this is a task for another day...

Thanks for your time!
